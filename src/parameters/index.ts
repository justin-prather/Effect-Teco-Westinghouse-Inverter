/**
 * @fileoverview Re-exports all parameter groups (Groups 00–22).
 *
 * Each group is a record of {@link ParamConfig} objects keyed by parameter code
 * (e.g. `p00_01`, `p01_00`). The schema engine lives in the `modbus-schema`
 * package; configs are converted into {@link ParamCallableOfEntry} bundles by
 * {@link TecoInverterService} at service construction time.
 *
 * @example
 * import { group00 } from "./parameters";
 * const config = group00.p00_01; // ParamConfig
 *
 * @module
